# DSArrays

Lab for Data Structure Arrays using Doubles

Today I learned more on the use of Doubles, the use of Math.pow, and horrendous Math Logic.

I don't claim to be a math whiz and probably never will be, however just like a mother giving birth
it is a necessary thing in life.

I also learned my spelling is suffering due to the added knowledge and faster typing.

Lastly I learned more about arrays and where to structure them due to my classmates and our 
wonderful TA Erik. Thanks ya'll.

Also don't worry about the other tabs in here. Mostly just for future reference and maybe to look at when I 
forget stuff. The main is all that matters "waves magic wand".
