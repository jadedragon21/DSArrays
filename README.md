# DSArrays

Lab for Data Structure Arrays using Doubles

Today I learned more on the use of Doubles, the use of Math.pow, and horrendous Math Logic.

I don't claim to be a math whiz and probably never will be, however just like a mother giving birth
it is a necessary thing in life.

I also learned my spelling is suffering due to the added knowledge and faster typing.

Lastly I learned more about arrays and where to structure them due to my classmates and our 
wonderful TA Erik. Thanks ya'll.

Hmm if you comment out  the main tab and uncomment & run the SumOfArray tab the sum comes out to 2021 lol.
Just remember after playing in the SOA tab to recomment and uncomment the main to rerun the main.

Also don't worry about the other tabs in here. Mostly just for future reference and maybe to look at when I 
forget stuff. The main is all that matters "waves magic wand".
